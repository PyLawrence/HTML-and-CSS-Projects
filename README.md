### Prebuilt Computers Site

This site is a basic HTML site styled using CSS, it contains a basic navbar, a contact form, and some images within containers.

### Wild Retreat Site

This site is another basic HTML site, it includes all of the features of the previous site, but implemented a little more elegantly, and also includes a parallax effect.

### Movie Theater Site

This site is styled with Bootstrap4 with some CSS, it includes a much better nav bar, a much cleaner design using the Bootstrap Jumbotron, modified cards, and badges.
